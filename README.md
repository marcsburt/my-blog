I built this blog to keep track of and share ideas about data analysis, web development, and anything else techy that I've picked up along the way.  I also wanted somewhere to post details about my professional experience.

This was built using AngularJS and a customized version of Bootstrap for the front end.  The backend consists of Firebase's database and Oauth system.  I used gulp and npm exclusively.  The scaffolding is based on Todd Motto's style guide.

Enjoy!
