			<p align = "justify">I’m the builder of this blog.  I’m also a part time student, career changer, data analyst, and web developer.  Let me explain.</p>
			<p align="justify">I’m originally from Germany and grew up in a military family.  I’ve lived in Texas, Tennessee, New York, and New Hampshire, but right now I live outside of Boston, MA.  I like it here and plan on sticking around for a while.</p>
			<p align ="justify">Originally I went to school for Psychology which led me to a fulfilling career in social work.  After spending seven years in the industry I decided to move on to something new.  So I went back to school for finance.  During that time a friend and I started a business doing freelance web design for local businesses.  We had a blast together, writing code and teaching ourselves new development frameworks.  Not to mention our work paid for a chunk our respective degrees.  Shortly after I graduated with an MBA, I landed a job as a financial planner.  It was great in that I combined all of those years in social work with the my new financial skills.  It was also a grind.  Long hours and a lot of the wrong kind of pressure made me reevaluate my career.  I am very happy that I did!</p>
			<p align = "justify">Turns out after all of that searching,  I figured out the thing I like most was the thing that has been a hobby all along.  It was web development!  Throughout it all, the one thing that remained constant is how much I read about and dabbled in writing code, learning about data, and building websites.   Now I’m taking a step further and going back to school for a computer science Master's.  I'm finally making a career out of it!<hr></p>
